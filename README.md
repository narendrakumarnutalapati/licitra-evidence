# LICITRA Evidence Repository (Patent Pending)

Cryptographically Verifiable Runtime Integrity for Agentic AI Systems.

This repository contains reproducible experiments, exported evidence bundles, and supporting documentation for LICITRA.

## What’s Included
- `docs/` threat model, scope, and experiment methodology
- `demo/` exported evidence bundles (JSON/PDF) used for demonstrations
- `experiments.md` step-by-step commands to reproduce tamper detection tests
- `proof.md` summary of results and what each artifact demonstrates
- `how_to_run.md` instructions to run the system locally

## Key Claims Demonstrated
- Hash-chained semantic event integrity (tamper detection)
- Multi-organization isolation (org1 chain independent from org2)
- Detection of record mutation, deletion, and previous-hash corruption
- Evidence bundles suitable for governance / audit workflows

## Core Implementation
