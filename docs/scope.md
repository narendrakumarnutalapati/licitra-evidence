# Scope

LICITRA provides cryptographic runtime audit infrastructure for agentic AI systems.

---

## In Scope

- Immutable event capture  
- Deterministic hash-chain verification  
- Tamper detection (payload, prev-hash, deletion)  
- Evidence export (JSON + PDF)  
- Minimal rollback logic (v0 decision primitive)  

---

## Out of Scope

- Model alignment  
- Policy enforcement  
- UX dashboards  
- Compliance workflows  
- Human review tools  

---

LICITRA is a technical primitive, not a governance platform.

It focuses exclusively on runtime integrity and forensic evidence generation.
